# Bio:

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group of [Joakim Stenhammar](https://www.stenhammargroup.com/) in the [Division of Physical Chemistry](https://www.physchem.lu.se/) at Lund University in Sweden. 

My research focus is theoretical [soft matter physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_matter), particularly the computational modelling of [non-equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics), biological systems across all scales. 

My current work focuses on [active turbulence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_fluid#Active_turbulence) in suspensions of microswimmers, such as the bacteria E. Coli: [active matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_matter) at the microscale. 

I completed my PhD in 2018 studying the dynamics of bird flocks, specifically under topological constraints: active matter at the macroscale. (Read my thesis here: "[Topological models of swarming](http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/133344/1/WRAP_Theses_Lewis_2018.pdf)")
