# Bio:

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group of [Joakim Stenhammar](https://www.stenhammargroup.com/) in the [Division of Physical Chemistry](https://www.physchem.lu.se/) at Lund University in Sweden. 

My research focus is theoretical soft matter physics, particularly the computational modelling of non-equilibrium, biological systems across all scales.
